### Propmt 1:
void EndElementHandler(const std::string &name){
        
    }

Can you explain to me what EndElementHandler wants me to do? 

### Response 1:
Certainly! The EndElementHandler function is a callback that gets invoked by the XML parser whenever it encounters the end of an XML element in the document being parsed. This function gives you an opportunity to perform any necessary actions or processing based on the end of the element.

Here's what you might typically do within the EndElementHandler:

Check the Name: The name parameter passed to the EndElementHandler function represents the name of the XML element that has just ended. You might want to inspect this name to determine which element has ended.

Process Element Data: If your XML document structure requires specific handling or processing when an element ends, you can implement that logic here. For example, if you're parsing an XML document representing a book, and each <book> element contains information about a book, you might want to gather all the data related to a book when the </book> element is encountered.

Update State or Data Structures: Depending on your application's needs, you might need to update some internal state or data structures to reflect the fact that an XML element has ended. For instance, if you're parsing a hierarchical structure like an XML tree, you might need to adjust the current node pointer or stack of nodes.

Error Handling: You might want to perform error handling or validation checks based on the element that has ended. For example, you could validate that certain required child elements were present within the parent element.

In summary, the EndElementHandler function provides a hook for you to respond to the end of XML elements during the parsing process. You can use it to perform any necessary actions or processing based on the specific requirements of your XML parsing application.
